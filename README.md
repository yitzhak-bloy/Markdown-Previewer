This is Markdown Previewer, built as part of the [five freeCodeCamp projects](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-libraries/front-end-libraries-projects/) to receive the Front End Libraries certificate.

The project was built in React, using the [marked library](https://github.com/markedjs/marked) to parser the markdown.

The app can be viewed [here](https://yitzhak-bloy.github.io/Markdown-Previewer/).
